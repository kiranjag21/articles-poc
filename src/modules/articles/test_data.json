We investigated the analgesic effects of an intravenous combination of acetaminophen and ibuprofen immediately after thyroidectomy.\nMETHODS: In this double-blind clinical trial, 62 patients who underwent thyroidectomies were randomized to either the treatment (1000 mg acetaminophen, 300 mg ibuprofen) or control (1000 mg acetaminophen) group. Postoperative pain intensity was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) 0, 15, and 30 min after recovery room admission.

        "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused changes in the consumption of prescribed/non-prescribed drugs and the population's habits, influencing the detection and concentration of emerging contaminants (ECs) in sanitary sewage and harming environmental and health risks. Therefore, the present work sought to discuss current literature data on the effects of the \"COVID-19 pandemic factor\" on the quality of raw sewage produced over a five-year period (2018-2019: pre-pandemic; 2020-2022: during the pandemic) and biological, physical, chemical and hybrid treatment technologies, influencing factors in the removal of ECs and potential ecological risks (RQs). Seven hundred thirty-one publications correlating sewage and COVID-19 were identified: 184 pre-pandemic and 547 during the pandemic. Eight classes and 37 ECs were detected in sewage between 2018 and 2022, with the \"COVID-19 pandemic factor\" promoting an increase in estrogens (+31,775 %), antibiotics (+19,544 %), antiepileptics and antipsychotics (+722 %), pesticides (+200 %), analgesics, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants (+173 %), and stimulant medications (+157 %) in sanitary sewage. Among the treatment systems, aerated reactors integrated into biomembranes removed >90 % of cephalexin, clarithromycin, ibuprofen, estrone, and 17β-estradiol. The absorption, adsorption, and biodegradation mechanisms of planted wetland systems contributed to better cost-benefit in reducing the polluting load of sewage ECs in the COVID-19 pandemic, individually or integrated into the WWTP. The COVID-19 pandemic factor increased the potential ecological risks (RQs) for aquatic organisms by 40 %, with emphasis on clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole, which changed from negligible risk and low risk to (very) high risk and caffeine with RQ > 2500. Therefore, it is possible to suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic intensified physiological, metabolic, and physical changes to different organisms in aquatic biota by ECs during 2020 and 2022.",

Classic DHRs result in induration, erythema, tenderness, and urticaria. However, soft tissue mass is an uncommon complication of a COVID-19 vaccination-associated DHR and is rarely reported in the literature. We present a case of a 49-year-old male who recognized a mildly painful, firm soft tissue mass within the biceps mimicking neoplasm six months after receiving the booster dose of the Moderna vaccine. Non-operative conservative treatment modalities, including heating pads, ice packs, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen, failed to improve the patient's mass. The mass, which proved histologically to be an inflammatory pseudo-tumor, did not recur after complete excision. While there have been many reported cases of DHRs following COVID-19 vaccinations, we present this case to raise awareness of the development of pseudo-tumors as a possible, yet rare, clinical manifestation of DHRs following vaccination.",

        "abstract": "The high failure rate of central nervous system (CNS) drugs is partly associated with an insufficient understanding of target site exposure. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability evaluation tools are needed to explore drugs' ability to access the CNS. An outstanding aspect of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models is the integration of knowledge on drug-specific and system-specific characteristics, allowing the identification of the relevant factors involved in target site distribution. We aimed to qualify a PBPK platform model to be used as a tool to predict CNS concentrations when significant transporter activity is absent and human data are sparse or unavailable. Data from the literature on the plasma and CNS of rats and humans regarding acetaminophen, oxycodone, lacosamide, ibuprofen, and levetiracetam were collected. Human BBB permeability values were extrapolated from rats using inter-species differences in BBB surface area. The percentage of predicted AUC and Cmax within the 1.25-fold criterion was 85% and 100% for rats and humans, respectively, with an overall GMFE of <1.25 in all cases. This work demonstrated the successful application of the PBPK platform for predicting human CNS concentrations of drugs passively crossing the BBB. Future applications include the selection of promising CNS drug candidates and the evaluation of new posologies for existing drugs.",

The time period covers both the COVID-19 pandemic and the post-pandemic periods; therefore, the impact of the implemented restrictions and the consequences of the illness in terms of the usage of pharmaceuticals thereon were investigated. Additionally, the seasonality and impact of the seasonal flu and other acute upper respiratory infections were studied. The results revealed that the pandemic impacted the consumption of alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine, as well as several pharmaceuticals, such as antihypertensives, antidepressants, psychiatric drugs, and the painkiller ibuprofen. The findings suggest that the imposed restrictions during the pandemic may have had a negative effect on the population's health and mental well-being. Distinct seasonal trends were discovered in the consumption patterns of caffeine and alcohol, where lower use was observed during the summer. The seasonal consumption trends of pharmaceuticals were discovered in the case of antibiotics, the antiasthmatic drug salbutamol, and the decongestant xylometazoline, where higher consumption occurred during colder seasons.",

NSAID-EE2 mixtures were administered in the drinking water from gestational day 8 until 8 weeks post-birth (i.e., during embryo development, lactation, puberty, and sexual maturity). The incidence of adenomyosis lesions (presence of endometrial glands in the inner myometrium) increased up to 60% in the uterus of 8-week-old exposed females (F1) and to 85% in F2 females (exposed father). Histological analysis revealed aberrant proliferation and apoptosis, vacuolization of epithelial cells, and increased incidence of abnormal glands in the luminal and glandular epithelium in F1 and F2 uteri. Moreover, myofibroblast proportion (alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression analysis) and collagen expression (Picrosirius red stain; a fibrosis hallmark) were increased in F1 and F2 endometrium. Connexin-43 was aberrantly distributed in the endometrial stroma and glands of F1 and F2 uteri. Conversely, uterine 17β-estradiol and progesterone levels were not affected in F1 and F2 females. These findings demonstrated that in mice, chronic exposure to NSAID and EE2 mixtures at environmental doses intergenerationally affects uterine physiology, particularly the endometrium. It may serve as a model to study the pathophysiology of human adenomyosis.",

        "abstract": "In contrast to conventional drug delivery systems, controlled drug release systems employ distinct methodologies. These systems facilitate the release of active substances in predetermined quantities and for specified durations. Polymer hydrogels have gained prominence in controlled drug delivery because of their unique swelling-shrinkage behavior and ability to regulate drug release. In this investigation, films with a hydrogel structure were crafted using polyvinyl alcohol, a biocompatible polymer, and silver nanoparticles. Following characterization, ibuprofen was loaded into the hydrogels to evaluate their drug release capacity. The particle sizes of silver nanoparticles synthesized using a green approach were determined. This study comprehensively examined the structural properties, morphological features, mechanical strength, and cumulative release patterns of the prepared films. In vitro cytotoxicity analysis was employed to assess the cell viability of drug-loaded hydrogel films, and their antibacterial effects were examined. The results indicated that hydrogel films containing 5% and 10% polyvinyl alcohol released 89% and 97% of the loaded drug, respectively, by day 14. The release kinetics fits the Korsmeyer-Peppas model. This study, which describes nanoparticle-enhanced polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel systems prepared through a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach, is anticipated to contribute to the existing literature and serve as a foundational study for future research.",

        "abstract": "The application of natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) in the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and food industries represents one of the fastest growing fields of green chemistry, as these mixtures can potentially replace traditional organic solvents. These advances are, however, limited by the development of new NADES which is today, almost exclusively empirically driven and often derivative from known mixtures. To overcome this limitation, we propose the use of a transformer-based machine learning approach. Here, the transformer-based neural network model was first pre-trained to recognize chemical patterns from SMILES representations (unlabeled general chemical data) and then fine-tuned to recognize the patterns in strings that lead to the formation of either stable NADES or simple mixtures of compounds not leading to the formation of stable NADES (binary classification). Because this strategy was adapted from language learning, it allows the use of relatively small datasets and relatively low computational resources. The resulting algorithm is capable of predicting the formation of multiple new stable eutectic mixtures (n = 337) from a general database of natural compounds. More importantly, the system is also able to predict the components and molar ratios needed to render NADES with new molecules (not present in the training database), an aspect that was validated using previously reported NADES as well as by developing multiple novel solvents containing ibuprofen. We believe this strategy has the potential to transform the screening process for NADES as well as the pharmaceutical industry, streamlining the use of bioactive compounds as functional components of liquid formulations, rather than simple solutes.",
